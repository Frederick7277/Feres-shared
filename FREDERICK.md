# Stock Taking App
Introduction
This app will be used to do stocktaking in a small Grocery Shop Related App
/ Similar Apps Existing Apps are intergrated in bespoke accounting packages.
There is often divergence between actual stock held and records in bespoke
accounting packages.

## APP Financial Controlling There are not many apps
able to undertake this exercise easily. Besides, it is important that Groceries
are aware of their actual valuation and report accurate information in their
accounts. The App itself and timing of exercise make it possible for owners
to assign a value to their assets. Existing systems do not entirely take into
account damages, theft and/or lost items. The physical stock taking is often
necessary and would be legally required. 
## Unique Features Conducting
a physical stock taking exercise, generating reports reflecting asset value for
individual departments and collective asset value to stock held by the Grocery.
### Additional Requirements. #### There are foreseen ancilliary devices
and systems needed for data handling, storage and retrieval. These include *
Printer * Scanner to scan product codes ** it is expected the Printer will have
a scanner of its own. However, the scanner considered here is a code reader *
Cloud Repository for data storage
NOTES: Essentially a Data management system will have to be built. The
description parameters and/or other requirements are yet to be established.
